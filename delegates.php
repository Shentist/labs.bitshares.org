     <h4 class="subheader">The BitShares network runs on Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS), a cutting edge security protocol that is laying the foundation for a new breed of blockchain-based technologies.</h4>
     
      <p> DPOS works by giving BitShares users the power to vote for 101 high speed node operators called delegates, who take turns digitally signing blocks of transactions at 10 second intervals. This democratic election of administrators allows for fair and consistent propagation of trades, and guarantees the timely and accurate validation of the blockchain record. </p>
     
      <p>The usefulness of DPOS as an engine for economic growth has attracted visionaries and software engineers to begin exploring its potential for other applications including civic voting, corporate stock issuance, music & entertainment, insurance, gaming & gambling, and DNS registry. Projects like Peertracks, Follow my Vote, and Play are now creating and exploring new ways to embrace the flexibility and robustness of a DPOS network. Blockchain based initiatives can now be launched and begin trading before they are fully featured, as the smooth “hard forking” capabilities of DPOS enables seamless integration with new applications as they are written.</p>

  <h3>Get Hired by the Blockchain</h3>
     <h4 class="subheader">BitShares uses a modification of DPOS which allows shareholder voting for paid delegates.</h4>
       <hr>
      <p>With each block signature, a delegate may be authorized to issue new BTS into the network at a fixed rate ( with a total maximum network dilution cap of 6% annually) [hyperlink: vesting/rate halving explanation], similar to the way a company uses stock dilution to raise capital for expansion. This is helping to “bootstrap” the growth of BitShares, and is paving the way for a new breed of talented visionaries who work directly for the BitShares blockchain. </p>
     
      <p>BitShares holders are very eager to utilize this tool for growth, and are constantly looking for fresh entrepreneurs. The need for qualified web and c++ developers, creative marketing strategists and multimedia producers is mobilizing BTS holders in a continuing effort to vote for the brightest and most innovative delegate teams and projects. If you have any of these skills, or a great idea for contributing to the growth and value of BitShares, please visit <a href="http://www.bitsharestalk.org " target="_blank">www.bitsharestalk.org</a> and join the conversation!</p>
