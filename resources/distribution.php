<p>BTS shareholders are a diverse group of people united with the common purpose of supporting and promoting the <a href="../resources/vision.php">BitShares vision.</a>  Since its formation, BitShares has established a firm set of guidelines to be followed in order to keep the community aligned both philosophically and economically. These guidelines are referred to as the “social consensus”.</p>

<p>The social consensus is an agreement that new projects and initiatives wanting to use the BitShares open source software must give at least 10% of their initial stake to the holders of BTS. We believe that blockchain technology is not only an amazing economic experiment, but an important social one as well. The idea behind sharedropping is that any future chain will always benefit by choosing to align itself with the ones who worked hard at making the technology possible. This is not a mandatory requirement, but more of a “thank you” to the supporters and developers that have donated time and resources to bringing it into the world.</p>

<p>BitShares has set an example of this social agreement by establishing its own sharedropping standards. The seed allocation of BitShares took place over a 1 year period, from November 2013 to November 2014, and was sharedropped on the following chains:</p>

       <p>AGS or Angelshares was a set of two donation addresses, one for bitcoins and one for PTS. The 200 day donation period, beginning January 1 2014, helped to fund the development of DPOS, the software that makes the BitShares decentralized exchange possible.  </p>

<p>In order to sharedrop on a chain, a snapshot must be taken of all the shareholders at a certain date and time. This snapshot is then incorporated into the genesis block, dividing a percentage of shares at the birth of the new chain amongst shareholders of the snapshotted chain. Snapshots are announced at least 2 weeks in advance, to allow holders of the target chain to collect their shares from the order books of a central exchange, or any wallet where the private keys are not controlled by the shareholder.</p>

<p>Sharedropping has proved to be a powerful tool for building momentum for new blockchain based projects. Since mid 2014, there are four independent projects currently underway that have recognized the significance of the BitShares social consensus, and used it to gain the support of BitShares holders. These are Peertracks, Play, Sparkle and DPOS Protoshares. Anyone who now buys or holds BitShares could be the potential recipient of countless more sharedrops in the future, as word spreads of the practical advantages of the BitShares toolkit.</p>
